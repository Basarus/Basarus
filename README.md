# Welcome to my profile

## About me:

My name is Oleg, I am 23 years old. I live in Russia, at the moment I am a student.

- In 2014, he began actively studying programming (HTML + CSS + Java). This was due to the banal desire to create your own server for the game Minecraft (And I learned the markup language for the company, because I was interested in the layout of sites).

- In 2015 he entered the Moscow State University

- In 2016, I was actively studying C# to create plugins for the Rust game servers. In the same year, he received an invitation and transferred to the Academy of the FSB of Russia.

- In 2017, I started studying JavaScript and NodeJS. After that, I started studying React.js and Vue.

- From 2017 to the present time, I have been developing servers on the GTA 5 platform. I provide advice and support to various servers. I have my own YouTube channel, where I post lessons and scripts on the subject of GTA 5 RP servers (and not only). In my free time, I am engaged in self-development, attending various courses and developing applications that are interesting to me.
